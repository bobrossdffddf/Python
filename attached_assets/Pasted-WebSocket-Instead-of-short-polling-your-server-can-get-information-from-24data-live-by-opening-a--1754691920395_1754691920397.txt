WebSocket:
Instead of short-polling, your server can get information from 24data live by opening a connection to our WebSocket.
A maximum of 3 connections can be made to the WebSocket. Your server should only need one.
Make sure your Origin header is not set, or is empty when requesting from your server. Browsers will always set the Origin header, and can't be used to connect to this WebSocket.

wss://24data.ptfs.app/wss

You should receive a stream of data in this format:

{
  "t": "EVENT_TYPE",
  "d": "any" // Object or Array. See `Event Types` section below for corresponding data types.
}
Event Types
"ACFT_DATA": AircraftData from the ATC 24 main server.
"EVENT_ACFT_DATA": AircraftData from the ATC 24 event server.
"FLIGHT_PLAN": Stream of submitted **FlightPlan**s for the ATC 24 main server.
"EVENT_FLIGHT_PLAN": Stream of submitted **FlightPlan**s for the ATC 24 event server.
"CONTROLLERS": Position[] claimed in #online-atc

Types:
AircraftData:
Object served with Key-Value pairs, callsigns being the key and corresponding data being the value.

{
  "Callsign-1001": { /*...*/ },
  "Callsign-1002": { /*...*/ }
}
Example:

{
  "Shamrock-1337": {                // Object key is the callsign of the aircraft.
    "heading": 290,                 // Heading in degrees. 360 is North.
    "playerName": "PTC_Helper",     // Roblox username of the pilot.
    "altitude": 3069,               // Altitude in ft of the aircraft. 1 stud = 1.8372 ft for this conversion.
    "aircraftType": "Airbus A380",  // Aircraft type.
    "position": {                   // Position of the aircraft in studs away from the origin.
        "y": -23349,                // -y is North.
        "x": -10906                 // -x is West.
    },
    "speed": 299,                   // Airspeed as reported in knots. NOTE: Not equivalent to nautical miles per hour. See details below.
    "wind": "357/15",               // Wind in degrees/speed in knots. See note for knots.
    "isOnGround"?: false,           // If the aircraft is in Taxiing mode. NOTE: This property is not included helicopter aircraft data.
    "groundSpeed": 208.660516305461 // Groundspeed as reported in knots. See note for knots
  },
  // ...
}
NOTE
The planekit uses knots internally, and applies 1 knot = 0.5442765 studs/sec to aircraft. This is actually lower than the real conversion, but is done so that runways can be smaller and islands feel farther apart.
The real conversion between knots and studs/sec is 1 knot = 0.918650795 studs/sec (Derived from 1 stud = 0.56 metres, the scale used in-game. Full derivation is left as an exercise to the reader).
If you need to do calculations related to expected distance and nautical miles, Real knots = game knots * 0.592172785.
3307.14286 studs = 1 NMi.

Additionally, aircraft are further slowed linearly dependent on altitude above 2,000ft in order to increase time spent in cruise. This is not shown in speed, but is in groundSpeed.

FlightPlan
A single filed Flight Plan. Only accessible through WebSocket.
Example:

{
  "robloxName": "PTC_Helper",       // Roblox username of command operator.
  "callsign": "Shamrock-1337",      // Set by user in command.
  "realcallsign": "Shamrock-1337",  // Also set by user, but should be in-game callsign.
  "aircraft": "A330",               // Aircraft filed.
  "flightrules": "IFR",             // IFR/VFR.
  "departing": "IMLR",              // Origin airport.
  "arriving": "IGRV",               // Destination airport.
  "route": "N/A",                   // Route if specified, "N/A" otherwise.
  "flightlevel": "040"              // Flight level.
}
Position[]:
Array of Positions
Example:

[
  {
    "holder": "AutumnHTDG", // Roblox username of the position holder.
    "claimable": false,     // If the position is claimable.
    "airport": "Rockford",  // Position's airport.
    "position": "Tower",    // Position type (Ground, Tower)
    "queue": [              // Array of Roblox usernames of people queued. [0] is first.
      "Orange12345",        // Number 1 in queue.
      "TreelonsMusk",       // Number 2 in queue.
    ]
  },
  {
    "holder": null,
    "claimable": true,
    "airport": "Rockford",
    "position": "Ground",
    "queue": []
  },
  // ...
